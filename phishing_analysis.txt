ðŸ§¾ Email Header Analysis

1. **Return-Path** shows sender as `admin@paypal-fake.com` â€” clearly a spoofed domain meant to look like PayPal.
2. **Received from** server is `suspicious.smtp12.ru` with IP `185.243.116.23` â€” origin from `.ru` domain is suspicious for PayPal.
3. **Message-ID** is generic and from `example.org`, not matching PayPalâ€™s domain.
4. **From** address is `service@paypal-fake.com` â€” again a fake domain mimicking official PayPal email.
5. **Reply-To** is a completely different email: `help@pay-pal-support.in` â€” redirection to an attacker-controlled inbox.
6. **SPF: FAIL** â€” Sender domain not authorized to send mail on behalf of PayPal.
7. **DKIM: none** and **DMARC: FAIL** â€” indicates email is not cryptographically verified and likely spoofed.

âœ… Conclusion:
The header confirms that this is a **spoofed phishing email**. It uses a fake domain, insecure mail server, and fails SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks â€” all strong indicators of phishing.
